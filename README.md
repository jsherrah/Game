Experiments with OpenGL in Java. Built using Maven. So far not too much to see. Basic movement with the 
mouse and keyboard. Press <return> to activate the mouse. 'a', 's', 'w', 'd' are used to move around. There
seems to be a bug with sideways movement in that it doesn't appear properly diagnoal to the foward and up views.

It is intended to add more objects to the system. As for now there are only two objects. An overlay panel for text
and a big cube.

If you run inside eclipse you need too add target/natives to the build path under the maven library.
